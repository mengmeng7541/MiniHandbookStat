Women were randomly assigned to either a placebo control group (group=0, n=27) or estrogen patch group (group=1, n=34). Prior to the first treatment all patients took the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). EPDS data was collected monthly for six months once the treatment began. Higher scores on the EDPS are indicative of higher levels of depression. Depression scores greater than or equal to 11 were coded as 1. install.packages(“gee”) de &lt;- read.table(&quot;c://data/gee.txt&quot;, header=TRUE) library(gee) y &lt;- (de$depressd ~ de$visit + de$group ) gee( y, id=de$subj, family=binomial, corstr=&quot;exchangeable&quot;) ## Beginning Cgee S-function, @(#) geeformula.q 4.13 98/01/27 ## running glm to get initial regression estimate ## (Intercept) de$visit de$group ## 2.3836603 -0.4402142 -1.6066020 ## ## GEE: GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS FOR DEPENDENT DATA ## gee S-function, version 4.13 modified 98/01/27 (1998) ## ## Model: ## Link: Logit ## Variance to Mean Relation: Binomial ## Correlation Structure: Exchangeable ## ## Call: ## gee(formula = y, id = de$subj, family = binomial, corstr = &quot;exchangeable&quot;) ## ## Number of observations : 295 ## ## Maximum cluster size : 6 ## ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) de$visit de$group ## 2.4089588 -0.3985943 -1.6158979 ## ## Estimated Scale Parameter: 1.00449 ## Number of Iterations: 3 ## ## Working Correlation[1:4,1:4] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1.000000 0.449131 0.449131 0.449131 ## [2,] 0.449131 1.000000 0.449131 0.449131 ## [3,] 0.449131 0.449131 1.000000 0.449131 ## [4,] 0.449131 0.449131 0.449131 1.000000 ## ## ## Returned Error Value: ## [1] 0 "]
