Women were randomly assigned to either a placebo control group (group=0, n=27) or estrogen patch group (group=1, n=34). Prior to the first treatment all patients took the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). EPDS data was collected monthly for six months once the treatment began. Higher scores on the EDPS are indicative of higher levels of depression. Depression scores greater than or equal to 11 were coded as 1. install.packages(“geepack”) de &lt;- read.table(&quot;c://data/gee.txt&quot;, header=TRUE) library(geepack) y &lt;- (de$depressd ~ de$visit + de$group ) gee &lt;- geeglm( y, id=de$subj, family=binomial, corstr=&quot;exchangeable&quot;) summary(gee) ## ## Call: ## geeglm(formula = y, family = binomial, id = de$subj, corstr = &quot;exchangeable&quot;) ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.err Wald Pr(&gt;|W|) ## (Intercept) 2.40952 0.48295 24.89 6.06e-07 *** ## de$visit -0.39840 0.07855 25.72 3.94e-07 *** ## de$group -1.61632 0.47957 11.36 0.000751 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Estimated Scale Parameters: ## Estimate Std.err ## (Intercept) 0.9944 0.2007 ## ## Correlation: Structure = exchangeable Link = identity ## ## Estimated Correlation Parameters: ## Estimate Std.err ## alpha 0.4518 0.1277 ## Number of clusters: 61 Maximum cluster size: 6 model: \\(\\eta=2.409-0.398visit-1.616group\\) "]
